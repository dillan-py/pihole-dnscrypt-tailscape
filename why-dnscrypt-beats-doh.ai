If your goal is maximum privacy from your ISP and strong authentication with DNSSEC, and you can only choose one upstream protocol, the answer is surprisingly clear:
⭐ DNSCrypt is the best single choice.
Let me break down why in a way that fits exactly how you think — threat‑model first, protocol second.

🔐 1. Privacy from ISP: DNSCrypt vs DoH
Both hide your DNS queries from your ISP, but they do it differently.
DoH
• 	Encrypts DNS inside HTTPS
• 	ISP sees: “You’re talking to Cloudflare over HTTPS”
• 	ISP cannot see DNS queries
• 	BUT: corporate firewalls and ISPs can intercept DoH using TLS inspection
DNSCrypt
• 	Encrypts DNS using a dedicated cryptographic protocol
• 	ISP sees: “You’re sending encrypted packets to a random IP”
• 	ISP cannot see DNS queries
• 	ISP cannot MITM DNSCrypt
• 	TLS‑inspection appliances cannot break it
Winner for ISP privacy:
👉 DNSCrypt
Because it cannot be intercepted or inspected by middleboxes.

🔐 2. Authentication: DNSSEC + resolver identity
You want two layers of trust:
Layer 1 — DNSSEC
Both DoH and DNSCrypt support DNSSEC validation.
So this part is equal.
Layer 2 — Resolver authentication
This is where the difference becomes huge.
DoH
• 	Authenticates only the HTTPS hostname
• 	Any server with a valid certificate for that hostname can impersonate the resolver
• 	No resolver‑level cryptographic identity
DNSCrypt
• 	Authenticates the resolver itself
• 	Uses a signed resolver certificate
• 	Uses a unique public key
• 	Prevents resolver impersonation
• 	Prevents MITM even if someone injects a fake TLS certificate
Winner for authentication:
👉 DNSCrypt
Because it provides cryptographic resolver identity, not just HTTPS hostname validation.

🔐 3. Attack surface
DoH
• 	HTTP/2
• 	TLS
• 	ALPN
• 	Reverse proxies
• 	Load balancers
• 	Web server stacks
More moving parts → more potential vulnerabilities.
DNSCrypt
• 	Lightweight
• 	Minimal parsing
• 	Purpose‑built
• 	Smaller attack surface
Winner for minimal attack surface:
👉 DNSCrypt

🧩 Final verdict
If you can only choose one protocol and your goals are:
✔ Hide DNS from ISP
✔ Strong authentication
✔ DNSSEC validation
✔ Minimal attack surface
✔ No TLS interception
✔ No resolver impersonation
